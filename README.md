A 'C' based program which converts work hours to excel data sheet with salary calculations ,Made for 'Gesco' Ltd. I Was approached by an accountant from Gesco Ltd and asked if i could make a boring and excruciating job such as filling boring old excel spread sheets with the companies employee work hours and doing calculations on the data , a bit easier and faster. so i created this small program according to all her guide lines and all the financial percentage that needs to be taken into mind. all that the program requires of you is to enter 
the entry hour and the exit hour of each day, and in the end of the process is exports a ready excel spread sheet which contains all the relevant data needed to be on the excel report.
